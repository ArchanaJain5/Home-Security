# Home-Security <br> <br>
In this IOT prototype, we will build a Home Security System using PIR Sensor and Pi Camera. This system will detect the presence of Intruder and quickly alert the user by sending him an alert mail with details and pictures of the same. This system can be installed at the main door of home or office and the user can monitor it from anywhere in the world using Email over the internet.  Hence, the home or office can be secured.
